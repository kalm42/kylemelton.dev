      <p>
        Californian native who has always liked web work. I started out studying
        to do graphic design but when I got the chance to design websites and
        fell in love with the fluid ever changing nature of a website. I changed
        my learning path and started learning how to make websites. I have been
        a one man show many times so I have enjoyed learning backend work as
        well. Iâ€™m relatively new to this and love working in teams so that I can
        learn new techniques for solving the everyday problems that arise. The
        best part of this career is getting to make stuff that works.
