          Californian native who has always liked web work. I started out
          studying to do graphic design but when I got the chance to design
          websites and fell in love with the fluid ever changing nature of a
          website. I changed my learning path and started learning how to make
          websites. I have been a one man show many times so I have enjoyed
          learning backend work as well.

          Iâ€™m relatively new to this and love working in teams so that I can
          learn new techniques for solving the everyday problems that arise. The
          best part of this career is getting to make stuff that works. My name
          is Kyle Alexander Lafayette Melton, KALM - which I am. My friends call
          me Kyle, or Melton.
